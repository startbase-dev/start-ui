# Changelog

The Changelog section is dedicated to documenting all notable changes made to the UI library. This includes updates, new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, and any other significant modifications. Keeping a detailed and organized changelog helps users track the evolution of the library, understand what changes have been made, and anticipate how these changes might affect their projects.

We encourage contributors and maintainers to keep this section up-to-date with each release to ensure transparency and to provide clear information about the progress and updates of the library.
