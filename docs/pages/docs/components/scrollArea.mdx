# ScrollArea

The ScrollArea provides customizable scrolling functionality for its child elements. It can be configured for horizontal or vertical scrolling, making it suitable for a variety of use cases where content exceeds the visible area.

## Installation

<Steps>
### Install the package
```sh copy npm2yarn
npm i @start-base/start-ui
```
### Add the styles

<Tabs items={["Next.js 14 (App Directory)", "Next.js 13", "React.js"]}>
    <Tabs.Tab label="Next.js 14 (App Directory)">
        To use the React form elements styles in a Next.js 14 project, import the styles in your `layout.tsx` file.

            In a distant galaxy, far beyond the reaches of the known universe,
            the remnants of the fallen Jedi Order were gathering in secret. Led
            by the last surviving Jedi Knight, Jor-El, they sought refuge on the
            forgotten planet of Thar&apos;os. Hidden beneath the planet&apos;s
            crimson sands lay ancient temples imbued with the Force, offering a
            glimmer of hope to the exiled warriors. As the Empire&apos;s shadow
            grew ever darker, whispers of a new hope began to spread among the
            remaining rebels, kindling the flame of resistance once more. Amidst
            the whispers, a young and untested Jedi named Lyria discovered a
            forgotten holocron that contained secrets of the Force long thought
            lost. This relic revealed the existence of a powerful artifact
            capable of restoring balance to the Force and weakening the
            Sith&apos;s grasp on the galaxy. Determined to find the artifact,
            Lyria embarked on a perilous journey across the stars, guided by
            visions of ancient Jedi Masters. Along the way, she encountered
            allies and enemies, each with their own motivations and ties to the
            Force. As Lyria&apos;s quest unfolded, the Emperor sensed a
            disturbance and dispatched his most formidable enforcer, Darth
            Malak, to hunt her down. The final confrontation took place on the
            storm-ravaged moon of Veltros, where Lyria, armed with the ancient
            artifact, faced Darth Malak in a battle that would decide the fate
            of the galaxy. With the strength of her ancestors flowing through
            her, Lyria defeated Malak and shattered the Sith&apos;s hold on the
            Force, igniting a new era of hope and unity for the galaxy. With
            Darth Malak vanquished, Lyria returned to Thar&apos;os with the
            ancient artifact, greeted by a renewed sense of hope among the
            surviving Jedi and rebels. The once-hidden temples of Thar&apos;os
            now thrummed with vibrant energy, as the Force began to heal from
            the Sith&apos;s corruption. Under Jor-El&apos;s wise leadership, the
            Jedi Order started to rebuild, training a new generation of Jedi who
            would safeguard peace and justice in the galaxy. The rebels,
            inspired by Lyria&apos;s courage and victory, rallied more systems
            to their cause, slowly but surely eroding the Empire&apos;s power.
            However, the Emperor was far from defeated. In the dark recesses of
            his throne room on Coruscant, he plotted his revenge. Summoning the
            most sinister dark lords and ruthless bounty hunters, he launched a
            relentless campaign to crush the rebellion and reclaim control.
            Despite their growing strength, the rebels faced overwhelming odds,
            with skirmishes breaking out across the galaxy. Lyria, now a symbol
            of hope, took on a crucial role in unifying the scattered rebel
            factions, using her connection to the Force to foresee and counter
            the Empire&apos;s attacks. In a climactic showdown, the rebels laid
            siege to the Emperor&apos;s stronghold on Coruscant. The battle
            raged in the streets and skies, with the fate of the galaxy hanging
            in the balance. Lyria, accompanied by Jor-El and her closest allies,
            infiltrated the Emperor&apos;s citadel. The final confrontation was
            intense, as the Emperor unleashed his full dark powers. But Lyria,
            drawing strength from the ancient artifact and the unity of the
            Force, stood firm. In a moment of sheer willpower, she and Jor-El
            combined their abilities, creating a wave of pure Force energy that
            obliterated the Emperor and his dark influence. Peace was finally
            restored, and the galaxy, now free from tyranny, began to heal and
            flourish under the guidance of the reborn Jedi Order.
